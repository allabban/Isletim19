FreeRTOS 4-Level Priority Scheduler Simulation1. Project OverviewThis project simulates a CPU Process Scheduler using the FreeRTOS Real-Time Kernel on a PC environment (Linux/POSIX). The goal was to design a custom scheduler that manages tasks based on strict priority rules, distinguishing between "Real-Time" tasks (high priority) and "User" tasks (standard priority).The system reads a list of processes from an input file (giris.txt), creates FreeRTOS tasks for them, and manages their execution, suspension, and termination based on a specific set of algorithms.2. Scheduling AlgorithmsThe scheduler implements a 4-Level Queue system:Priority 0 (Real-Time Queue):Algorithm: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS).Behavior: These tasks have absolute priority. If a Real-Time task arrives, it preempts any running User task immediately. They run until completion without time slicing.Priority 1 & 2 (User Queues):Algorithm: Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ).Behavior: New User tasks start at Priority 1. They are given a 1-second Time Quantum. If a task does not finish within 1 second, it is suspended, its priority is degraded (e.g., 1 $\to$ 2), and it is moved to the lower priority queue.Priority 3 (Lowest Queue):Algorithm: Round Robin (RR).Behavior: Tasks that fall to Priority 3 share the CPU in a circular fashion until they finish.3. Key Features & ConstraintsStarvation Prevention (Timeout Rule):A strict rule was implemented where any task (waiting or running) that stays in the system for 20 seconds is automatically terminated with a "Timeout" (zamanaşımı) status.Task Identification:Tasks are identified by name (e.g., proses) and unique IDs. The output uses specific ANSI Colors based on the Task ID to visually distinguish processes in the terminal.Formatted Logging:The system outputs precise logs at every second, detailing the current time, task state (başladı, yürütülüyor, askıda, sonlandı, zamanaşımı), priority level, and remaining burst time.4. Implementation DetailsLanguage: CKernel: FreeRTOS (v10.x with GCC/Posix Port)Files:main.c: Entry point, initializes the simulation.scheduler.c: Contains the core logic (vSchedulerTask), handles the queues, preemption, and timeout checks.task.c: Handles the visual output (printTaskLog) and dummy workload logic.giris.txt: Input dataset defining Arrival Time, Priority, and Burst Time.FreeRTOSConfig.h: Configuration file for the FreeRTOS kernel settings.5. ResultsThe simulation successfully replicates the expected behavior:Real-Time tasks block User tasks correctly.User tasks degrade in priority over time.Tasks that starve for 20 seconds are correctly identified and killed.The output format aligns perfectly with the project requirements, including column alignment and color coding.
